            <h1>Hi, my name is Angela.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I'm an 18-year-old Asian American journalist, advocate and artist.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You're about to embark with me on my journey, a little endeavor known as life. This is my story on becoming who I was, who I am, and who I strive to be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hang on tight.</p>

            <h2>The first item I grabbed as a baby was a pen.</h2>
            <p>In Chinese culture, there's a game infants play when they turn one, called “zhuazhou." A row of items like books, stamps, and balls are laid out in front of the baby to choose; whichever item they choose is a representation of their career and future.
            <br>
            <br>
            So when that day came for me, naturally, given my complex brain of eternal wisdom, baby Angela was faced with a dilemma. It was now or never; I had to make a choice. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Slowly crawling, I was conflicted but determined. My drowsy, glazed eyes meandered across the items—when my eyes caught sight of the pen.
            <br>
            <br>
            And though I can't say this event had any real impact on my future, I'm here, today, as a writer. Here are a few of my works that flowed from pens ever since the one I had as a baby.
