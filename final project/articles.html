        <h1>Mobile-ization in the Ukraine-Russia war: How social media grows social movements in times of crisis
        </h1>
        <p>
<br>
In WithUkraine, a group chat on the social media app Telegram, each minute that passes is a moment of history recorded live. Subscribers send in hundreds of images, news from non-English outlets and videos of war-torn Ukrainian regions from the ground, chat bubbles appearing one after another — for 12,429 followers across the world.
<br>
<br>
Yet, 12,429 is not simply a number. For many recent movements like WithUkraine, social media plays a pivotal role in rallying together individuals for their cause. Russia’s invasion into Ukraine has sparked not only floods of headlines on a user’s feed, but more, the mass mobilization of citizens across the globe.
<br>
<br>
“We can really have an impact via social media,” said Rym Badran, a Lebanese university student and gender equity activist. 
<br>
<br>
Badran said she first realized the power of social media when her organization, Girl Up Lebanon, posted an infographic about her country’s “kafala” system. Within a few days, the post went viral. A petition she started shortly after garnered 90,000 signatures in a few weeks.
<br>
<br>
“When the Port explosion happened in Lebanon, I really wanted to see the people speaking about Beirut,” Badran said. “That’s why I was happy to see Ukraine getting enough attention, because we live in a world where a lot of important topics go unnoticed.”
<br>
<br>
Online conversation on social issues has grown rapidly in the past few years. According to a study from the Pew Research Center, 59% of social media users from ages 18 to 29 found social media helpful in discovering spaces to share viewpoints on social movements.
<br>
<br>
Sophia Delrosario, a high school senior from New Jersey, shares the opinion of that majority; for uniting widespread audiences, “social media can be a great tool.” 
<br>
<br>
“It's about people with different worldly backgrounds being connected by social media,” said Delrosario. As the founder and director of Zenerations, a Gen Z collective of articles with over 100,000 Instagram followers, she leads her team in amplifying stories of the Ukrainian people.
<br>
<br>
However, the mass rallying of attention towards communities in need does not come without risks. Ila Prabhuram, a high school sophomore from Georgia, said she understood how influential social media became in her organization, GenZ Writes, when its post describing the social movements of the past summers amassed almost 200,000 likes — and many hateful comments. 
<br>
<br>
“Discourse is inevitable — it'll always happen in the social activist sphere,” she said. Alongside personal attacks her team received, Prabhuram said attention shifted to the truthfulness of the stories they published on social media. 
<br>
<br>
“There is part of media that is very sensationalized,” she said. “That contributes to the growth of misinformation.” 
<br>
<br>
For those with ties to Ukraine and Russia through family, the intention of information becomes more prevalent. Victoria Brezko-Frolova, a journalist who has a Ukrainian mother and an ethnically Russian father, utilizes imagery to present information about the crisis on her Instagram, “boisdejasmin,” to more than 22,700 readers. 
<br>
<br>
But beyond the numbers, Brezko-Frolova said she wanted to humanize the conflict, through sharing online the beauty of the region she held many memories in.
<br>
<br>
“An incredibly tragic history, but a history so resilient — what I can do is write about it,” said Brezko-Frolova. “After all, why are the people in Ukraine fighting so hard? They want to protect the beautiful side.” 
<br>
<br>
Preserving these stories, she said, is a responsibility everyone has. 
<br>
<br>
Storytelling for awareness on social media remains everlastingly important — especially for those in Ukraine, like Andrii Tymchenko and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah Tymchenko.
<br>
<br>
The two called from their basement during a warning of a Russian air strike in their city.
<br>
<br>
“Tell your friends, tell your comrades: we can see, from our windows, black smoke,” Tymchenko said shakily. “This is the current situation.” 
<br>
<br>
Spreading awareness in moments like these is why social media is so essential, Hanna Tymchenko said. At the end of the day, she said, it is a space to mobilize — and share stories like theirs to the world. 
<br>
<br>
“Everyone at the bottom has Instagram,” said Hanna. “And from there, can learn about everything — and maybe this motivates them to take decisive action.”
